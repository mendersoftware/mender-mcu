#### Design note ###
#
# Ideally, we would have used the existing hook from Zephyr project to trigger the
# Mender Artifact build as a "Build Event"
# (https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_custom_command.html#build-events)
# through extra_post_build_commands with something like:
#
# set_property(
#     GLOBAL APPEND PROPERTY extra_post_build_commands COMMAND ${mender_artifact_cmd}
# )
# set_property(
#     GLOBAL APPEND PROPERTY extra_post_build_byproducts ${mender_artifact_output}
# )
#
# However, the Mender Artifact post build command would depend on the signed
# kernel, which is in itself generated through a post build command
# (https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/v4.0.0/cmake/mcuboot.cmake#L149)
# and there is no way to "sort" the command or declare interdependencies between
# them.
#
# So here is the workaround: as a post build command just remove the Artifact,
# so that we clear any stale Artifact every time that we build a new kernel. And
# then as custom target that runs always, we check and generate the Artifact
# opportunistically.
